      <p>Hi, I’m Shreesh, and I love computers.</p>

      <p>
        I’m primarily interested in computer architecture and design but I also
        make time to appreciate machine learning, physics and technology
        businesses.

        After sunset, I can be found reading anything and everything from the
        back of a shampoo bottle to mushy memoirs. I also love playing the
        guitar, video games, masala dosa, running and sleeping.

      <em><u>Now;</u></em>
      I am a graduate student at
      <em><strong class="text-[#C41230]">Carnegie Mellon University</strong></em
      >, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I will be interning
      with the GPU ASIC team at
      <em><strong class="text-[#76B900]">Nvidia</strong></em> in Santa Clara, California
      during the summer of 2025 🏄‍♂️
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><u>Then;</u></em> I graduated from
      <em
        ><strong class="text-[#f57025]">Manipal Institute of Technology</strong
        ></em
      >
      with a bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering and a minor in
      Computer Science. I was part of my university’s AI Robotics Team,
      <a href="https://projectmanas.in/" class="link">Project MANAS</a>, where
      we worked on a self-driving car and an autonomous robot that won the world
      grand prize at the
      <a href="http://www.igvc.org/" class="link"
        >Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition</a
      >
      in Michigan in 2019. I was also on the founding team of Manipal's
      <a href="https://ieee-ras-manipal.github.io/Website/" class="link"
        >IEEE Robotics and Automation Society</a
      >, and served as the Chairperson for the chapter during 2021 - 2022.

      <em><u>More;</u></em> I was born in Lucknow and brought up around Gurgaon.
      I spent 4 years in Manipal (half and half on beaches and campus) followed by
      a year in Bangalore. After this 5 year long sprint of making some of the best
      memories, mistakes and friends, I decided to take some time off to plan my
      next sprint. I moved to the US in July '23 and it's been a rollercoaster ever
      since - but more on that later (:

      This is a blog about my big and small wins, and the ride in between. I
      post about the things I’ve built and the problems I’m solving. I also
      maintain a commonplace notebook, where I collect things I want to remember
      ∩ things I don’t mind the internet knowing.
